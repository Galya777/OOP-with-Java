Homework No. 4
Submit the IntelliJ projects, where all Java files developed to solve the problems listed below.
Use comments and Modified-Hungarian notation.
Problem No. 1 (use the sample code Lab3bSampleCodeFig7.rar from Week3, Practical
work)
Coupon collector is a classic statistics problem with many practical applications. The
problem is to pick objects from a set of objects repeatedly and find out how many
picks are needed for all the objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the
problem is to pick cards from a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how
many picks are needed before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card is
placed back in the deck before picking another. Write a program to simulate the
number of picks needed to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards
picked (it is possible a card may be picked twice). Here is a sample run of the
program:
Problem 2
Write a class AlgebraUtils with a static method to multiply two matrices. The
definition of the method is:
public static double[][] multiplyMatrix(double[][] a, double[][] b)
To multiply matrix a by matrix b, the number of columns in a must be the same as the
number of rows in b, and the two matrices must have elements of the same or
compatible types. Let c be the result of the multiplication. Assume the column size of
matrix a is n. Each element cij is
For example, for two 3 * 3 matrices a and b, c is
A. Create a jar file with class AlgebraUtils
B. Create a separate IntelliJ project with class
AlgebraUtilsTst that imports the class AlgebraUtils
and in its main() method generates two 3 * 3
matrices with random 2- digit numbers and displays
their product.
Problem No.3.
Draw a square-shaped spiral (as in the screen capture given below), centered in
the application window, using a JavaFX application. One technique is to use a
loop that increases the line length after drawing every second line. The direction
in which to draw the next line should follow a distinct pattern, such as down, left,
up, right.
